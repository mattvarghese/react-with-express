# Frontend 

I created the frontend following this tutorial on Youtube [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siTUv1L9ymM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siTUv1L9ymM).

However, that video refers to an older Tailwind CSS install process.
Instead, I used [https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite).

# Backend

The backend was created with Express, and is fairly straightforward.

# Running the code

I used "concurrently" to be able to run both frontend and backend together from the parent folder. 

To run the code, `cd` into the top level folder and do `npm run start`. To build, do `npm run build` and to clean, do `npm run clean`.
